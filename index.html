                        <p>William Harrison born March 11, 1985 in Greensboro, NC. Now lets skip ahead after High
                            school
                            William
                            graduated from UNC-Greensboro in 2007 with a bachelor degree in Small Business. Taking his
                            new
                            small
                            business degree he went to work for his family business at Graham Sporting Goods in
                            Burlington,
                            NC. </p>
                        <p> 5 years later he moved back to Greensboro and started the website GrahamSG.com. Where he
                            sells
                            hats,
                            socks, shirts and other sporting goods apparel online. The site has been gradually growing
                            over
                            the
                            last few years and is becoming one of the larger dealers of custom hats in the southeast.
                            Looking to
                            expand his website and brand William is taking a coding course hoping on taking is website
                            to
                            the next
                            level.
                        </p>
                        <p>What does William enjoy doing in his free time?</p>
                        <p> William has a wife named Katelin, a 3 year old daughter named Lilly and a Karelian Bear Dog
                            named
                            Bella. I suggest googling about Karelian Bear Dogs. They are rare and unique breed of dogs.
                            William
                            spends his limited free time hanging out with his family and hiking in the mountains. </p>
